                <p>The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) is a flagship scheme of the Indian government aimed at providing continuous power supply to rural India. Named after the renowned political philosopher Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, the scheme was launched in July 2015 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Its primary objective is to strengthen and augment the distribution infrastructure in rural areas, thereby ensuring round-the-clock power supply to households, agricultural consumers, and rural enterprises.</p>
                <p>The Underground Project refers to initiatives aimed at underground cabling of power lines in urban and peri-urban areas. Underground cabling involves burying power cables underground instead of overhead lines supported by poles. </p>

discussions at state and federal levels on the critical need to expand transmission systems in the 
region, and are in the process of studying and planning transmission expansion projects

ensure our transmission system integrates well with other utility systems in the Western
